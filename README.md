I don't know where to put this, so here is my list of useful links:

Open source books (a LOT of them): https://www.intechopen.com/about-intechopen

# Math
* Terrence Tao's notes, he derives a Fourier Transform and talks about Lebesgue measures: https://terrytao.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/epsilon.pdf


# Transforms/Complex analysis
* Cool Rice university course (with recorded lectures) on Mathematical Methods from the Physics department:
https://www.ruf.rice.edu/~baring/phys516/phys516_record.html

# PCA
* Tutorial https://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.1100.pdf

# Stats
* Great website with lots of stats stuff: https://www.statlect.com/
* Variance estimate of normal distribuition: https://www.statlect.com/fundamentals-of-statistics/variance-estimation#:~:text=Variance%20estimation%20is%20a%20statistical,estimator%20of%20the%20population%20variance.
* Stdev estimate of stdev: https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/28567
* Really cool probability course book: https://www.probabilitycourse.com/preface.php

# DSP
Really cool book about DSP: https://www.dspguide.com/

Here is an article about random sampling: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.0839.pdf

Here is an article about time-interleaved sampling: https://www.analog.com/en/analog-dialogue/articles/interleaving-adcs.html#:~:text=Time%20interleaving%20is%20a%20technique,of%20each%20individual%20data%20converter

Correcting the distortion caused by window function: https://community.sw.siemens.com/s/article/window-correction-factors
(however, coherent gain (a.k.a. DC gain) assumes that sum(win)!=1, if sum(win)=1, then coherent gain=1).

Zeropadding vs repeating signal to get more resolution: https://www.penwatch.net/cms/fft_sampling/

Cool page about windows and their figures of merit: https://www.recordingblogs.com/wiki/processing-gain

# Wifi DSP

Book about wireless DSP processing: https://www.rle.mit.edu/sia/books/wireless-communications-signal-processing-perspectives/

Survey of wifi tech (and required theory): https://www.people.vcu.edu/~ebulut/COMST22_WiFi_Sensing_Survey.pdf

Related to [CSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_state_information): [article](https://7fa7a724-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/mdanishnisar/pubs/21_Robust_Channel_Est_Nisar_TSP_2010.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7cqzw5YcZj4oBRZHWPD6SUu4ZdjKmfpv89ch1vTEkTKc1ppFAWs690GM-ws7WSjUo5M2kyQJPA1pe-yt2sx8_lkuc7nQXIeDwZZbeFsUGtUQ2y3B5MWpv5IcyUwqwnHZYEY20SUSrm-5olD0-1Ijqqq1U9jvg1_qQ_T3x8--52-WxLwTF3f455xIF4fgzQVdO4vpndarl3kDYdATPbkznh23BKVk50VE9Rnj_nI2p-Vc2BwUeQT8mfs4bvvUVukpYrGAzFUi&attredirects=0)

## Wavelets
* A guide about wavelet tranform (has 4 parts): https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~unjung/mylec/WTpart1.html

## Random processes
* Deriving frequency response of a instantiation of a random process passed through a window: https://radarsp.weebly.com/uploads/2/1/4/7/21471216/dft_of_noise.pdf
* How to interpret power density spectra of random processes: https://www.sgu.ru/sites/default/files/textdocsfiles/2014/10/29/random_proc_slides_5_psd_2pages.pdf
* Lecture on different methods of estimating power density spectra of random process (periodogram, Bartlett and Welch's methods): http://www.laurent-duval.eu/Documents-Common/Schuster_G_2010_lect_spectrum_upbw.pdf
* Standford lectures on DSP, in particular section on pink noise: https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/sasp/Example_Pink_Noise_Analysis.html
* Cyclostationary process from arxiv: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.05586.pdf
  - They literally discuss how to reason about demodulatino and filtering with a window in their two exmplaes.

Some notes on estimating power spectrum density for random process:

We could potentially estimate the autocorrelation function (e.g. through averaging) and then FFT that and get the PSD for the random process, however, it seems that direct calculations of periodograms and averaging them is the preferred method from a calculation standpoint.
